## Description
The Diamond Problem Resolver is a C++ program designed to address the "diamond problem" that arises in multiple inheritance scenarios. The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to ambiguity in method resolution and potential conflicts. This program implements solutions to resolve the diamond problem and ensure correct behavior in such inheritance hierarchies.

## Features
Ambiguity Resolution: Provides mechanisms to resolve ambiguity in method calls resulting from multiple inheritance.
Virtual Inheritance: Utilizes virtual inheritance to eliminate duplicate copies of base class members in the derived class hierarchy.
Flexibility: Offers options for handling method conflicts and ensuring consistent behavior across different inheritance scenarios.
Testing: Includes test cases and examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the diamond problem resolution techniques.

## Examples
Basic Example: Demonstrates how virtual inheritance eliminates duplicate base class members and resolves ambiguity in method calls.
Advanced Example: Illustrates more complex inheritance hierarchies and demonstrates various techniques for handling method conflicts in different scenarios.
## Implementation
The Diamond Problem Resolver is implemented in C++, utilizing concepts such as virtual inheritance, method overriding, and method hiding to resolve conflicts arising from multiple inheritance. It may include one or more source files containing the implementation of diamond problem resolution techniques.
